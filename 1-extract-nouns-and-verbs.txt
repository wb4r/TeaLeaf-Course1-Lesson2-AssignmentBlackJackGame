## REQUIREMENTS:

In BJ there is a DEALER and at least one PLAYER. We have a DECK of 52 cards of 
2-DECKs and each PLAYER and DEALER will receive a hand, shown in the table-board. 

We start with 2 shown cards per PLAYER and the DEALER only shows 1. The PLAYER 
will hit or stay. Hit is asking for another card from the DECK and staying is giving place to 
the DEALER to hit more cards. The PLAYER has to try to be as closest as possible
from 21, if it overpasses its game over. When its the DEALER turn he will hit cards 
from the DECK at least until 17, if it overpasses, the PLAYER wins.
